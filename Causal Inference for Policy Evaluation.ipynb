    "- There is a large correlation between page location and clickthrough rate\n",

    "\n",
    "### Conventions and Approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Come up with a way to separate correlations from causality (deal with confounders)\n",
    "  - Randomized experiment\n",
    "  - \"Natural experiments\"\n",
    "    - I.e., to learn about military service, study the randomness of draft numbers in the Vietnam draft\n",
    "    - If one state changes a law and a neighboring state doesn't\n",
    "    - __Caveat:__ sometimes difficult to identify a control group or construct a synthetic one\n",
    "  - Assume that agents respond optimally to confounders, and infer them\n",
    "    - For instance, we don't know how much exactly people value the Staples brand, so it's difficult to estimate the brand component in pricing, but if we assume Staples has economists designing maximization pricing models, we can assume some latent factors\n",
    "2. Estimate a model\n",
    "  - *__NOT__ the best in-sample fit!!!!*\n",
    "  - Focus on estimation of treatment effect parameters or predictions about the impact of a treatment\n",
    "\n",
    "__Key differences with supervised machine learning__\n",
    "1. Train/test paradigm breaks\n",
    "  - Ground truth is not observed for your ultimate goal\n",
    "  - If we give half the room coffee, and not the other:\n",
    "    - We don't know how alert one half would have been *without* it\n",
    "    - We don't know how alert the other half of the room would have been *with* it\n",
    "  - Ultimately a missing data problem\n",
    "    - We can't draw inferences\n",
    "  - Even with randomized experiments, can't have good predictions at personal level, just group-wide level\n",
    "2. The objective function is different\n",
    "  - Trying to predict the effect of a treatment rather than an outcome\n",
    "  - Sacrifice MSE of outcome predictions\n",
    "    - For the sake of pursuing better MSE on out-of-sample predictions on effect\n",
    "3. Statistical properties often table stakes\n",
    "  - Want to prove the effect is real, and not just sample variance\n",
    "  - However, impediment to the progress of science\n",
    "\n",
    "__Key similarities with supervised machine learning__\n",
    "1. Prediction is key component of causal inference\n",
    "2. Causal inference in big data settings benefits from flexible model selection\n",
    "3. Problems of causal inference are prevalent in settings where ML is used\n",
    "  - What is the effect of the position of an ad or an algorithmic link in search?\n",
    "  - How many clicks would an ad receive if it were placed in the first position?\n",
    "  - Personalized recommendations or policies\n",
